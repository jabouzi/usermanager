    <h1>The 100% Easy-2-Read Standard</h1>
    <time datetime="2006-11-17">17 November 2006</time>
    <p>Using 10 pixel Verdana made sense in a time when screens were 640 pixels wide. Today it is a mistake.</p>
<p>There are some great arguments for small font sizes. Here are the top three:</p>
<ul>
<li>With smaller type sizes we can avoid scrolling</li>
<li>We can always adjust the font size</li>
<li>Busy pages covey rich content, they look more professional</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use small type because you want to spare us from scrolling: 
Relax, scrolling is fine. Flipping pages in books is fine, too. Being 
able to read the text is key. Telling your reader to “get glasses” is 
funny—especially if they already wear them. But designing bent over with
 your face glued to the screen is bad for your back; try leaning back 
and continue designing in a relaxed position. Your designs will be more 
relaxed, and so will you.</p>
<p>Sure, people <em>can</em> adjust the font size, but do you <em>want</em>
 to? Do you want to adjust your car seat every time you get in? 
Expecting your users to zoom in every time puts them in a similar 
position. Adjusting the font size beyond matters of sheer accessibility 
can be a delicate matter, and most users are not typographic 
specialists. The type size a designer chooses should have little to do 
with taste or personal prevalence. Unless you have diminished eye sight,
 the readability of a typeface finds its optimum in a narrower range 
than one might think.</p>
<p>Throwing all kinds of information at the user is lazy, and makes for a
 disorienting experience. We are paid to think about the content, and 
make choices between what is important and what isn’t.</p><p></p>
<h2>Five Simple Rules</h2>
<h3>1. Standard font size for long texts</h3>
<p>To realize how small the text is on many websites, compare to a book 
that you feel comfortable reading, then change the font size until the 
type on the book and the screen are about the same size:</p>
<figure><img src="assets/responsive-typography-reading-distance.png" alt="Responsive typography and reading distance"></figure>
<p>It will look big if you hold the book right next to the screen, but 
it will look fine if you hold the book at a comfortable reading 
distance. Congratulations, you’ve probably ended up at about the browser
 default of 100%, if not larger. As long as you respect the reading 
distance, this works across devices too.</p>
<p>Initially it is more difficult to create a visually pleasing layout 
with a bigger font size, but that challenge will help you design a 
simpler, clearer site. Anyone can cram a page with information, but 
making it simple and easy-to-use is hard. At first, you will be shocked 
how big the default text is. But after a day you won’t want to see 
anything smaller, and you quickly realize why all browsers use the 
default text size.</p>
<h3>2. Active white space</h3>
<p>Let your text breathe. Again, this is not about taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The width of the column must be proportioned to the size of the type.
 Overlong columns are wearying to the eye and also have an adverse 
psychological effect. Overshort columns can also be disturbing because 
they interrupt the flow of reading and put the reader off by obliging 
the eye to change lines too rapidly.<br>
—<cite>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</cite>, Josef Müller-Brockmann</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having space around the text reduces the stress level, as it’s much 
easier to focus. You don’t need to fill the whole window. White space 
looking nicer is a consequence of functional design. Who said websites 
need to be crammed with stuff?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question of the column width is not merely one of design or format; the question of legibility is of equal importance.<br>
—<cite>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</cite>, Josef Müller-Brockmann</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure that the line length (text column width, also called “the 
measure”) is not too wide, and that you add room on the left and right 
to make it easy for the eye to move from line to line. We don’t want to 
adjust either the font size or window size. When we open a website, we 
just want to read away. Column widths that scale are nice; never-ending 
text lines all across the screen are not.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, fit about 10-20 words per line. For liquid 
layouts on desktops a 50% column width (in relation to window size) is a
 good benchmark to get started.</p>
<h3>3. Reader-friendly line height</h3>
<p>Line height is a delicate issue. But if you know the basics, you can get pretty far. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lines that are too narrowly set impair reading speed because the 
upper and lower line are both taken in by the eye at the same time The 
eye cannot focus on excessively close lines and … the reader expends 
energy in the wrong place and tires more easily. The same also holds 
true for lines that are too widely spaced.<br>
—<cite>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</cite>, Josef Müller-Brockmann</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default HTML line height is too small. If you increase the line 
height, the text becomes more readable. For type on screen, 140% leading
 is a good benchmark.</p>
<h3>4. Clear color contrast</h3>
<p>If you are a web designer and believe you can get away with one of 
the following combinations, you might think about changing jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light grey text on a lighter grey background </li>
<li>Silver colored text on a snow white background</li>
<li>Grey text on a yellow background </li>
<li>Yellow text on a red background</li>
<li>Green text on a red background, and so on…</li>
</ul>
<p>If you insist you are a web designer, then you have to be aware that 
no one will ever find out that you exist, as no one will ever be able to
 read what you say. Let us see what you type. Note: for low resolution 
screens, an overly strong contrast (full black and white) is not ideal 
either, as the text starts to flicker. Benchmark: <code>#333</code> on <code>#fff</code>.</p>
<h3>5. No text in images</h3>
<p>We want to be able to search text, copy text, save text, play with 
the cursor, and mark text while we read. Text in images might look 
pretty, but <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020819.html">information needs to be readable</a> and usable and scalable and citable and sendable first.</p>
<p>If you can’t make your website look nice without text in images, I am afraid that you will have to start again from scratch.</p>    <hr>
